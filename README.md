**About the Project**

This project was made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In todays society, we have so many different devices and responsive design isn't just a nice feature, it is necessary. Nobody wants to have a horizontal scroll.

**Project Improvement**

In the future, I would love to learn how to make the buttons function and to add an animation to the like button after it is clicked.
