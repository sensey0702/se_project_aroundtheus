**About the Project**

This project was made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. In todays society, we have so many different devices and responsive design isn't just a nice feature, it is necessary. Nobody wants to have a horizontal scroll. I am currently working on the modals functioning, forms functioning, and refactoring my code to be object oriented.

**Project Improvement**

In the future, I would love to change the avatar and to add an animation to the like button after it is clicked.
